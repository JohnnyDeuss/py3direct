# py3direct
Chrome extension to redirect all Python docs to a given version.
You can set the version you want it to redirect to in the options.
If a visited docs page doesn't exist for the version you want, it will not be redirected.

~~This extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/py3direct/jdbjaddimbjackmobbmhcloaockenmio)
and on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/pythonredirect).~~ The extension is no longer available through the Chrome and Firefox extension stores, as Python 2 docs are now rarely linked.
